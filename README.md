# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This analysis was created to provide Louise with benchmark data she can compare to the performance for her recent "Fever" play, which came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time.

### Purpose
More specifically, to give her references regarding outcomes according to Launch Date, as well as outcomes based on the amount set as the funding Goal for comparable kickstarter projects.

## Analysis and Challenges
Two simple analysis were therefore created:
* Outcomes of Theater projects based on launch date
* Outcomes of plays based on Goals

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

An average of 13 Theater kickstarting projects have been launched each month for the last 9 years. 8 of which were succesfully funded, while the rest failed or were canceled. Most campaigns are launched between May and July, with the months of May and June also showing the highest rate of succesfully funded projects despite the large amount of competition.
On the other side of the spectrum, the months of October and December show the highest number of failed campaigns, despite the smaller amount of launched campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

To make goals more comparable with "Fever", we will focus only on the subcategory "plays" within the "Theater" category. Overall, 67% of plays were succesfully funded, regardless of their Goals. **Projects below $5,000 and those between $35,000 to $44,999 were particularly succesful in reaching their goals.**

Simultaneously, **campaigns between $25,000 to $34,999 and those over $45,000 had the highest ratio of failed projects.**

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It's easy to assume causality in terms of the date and goal having a direct effect on the probability of success. However, we can only show a correlation in the data-set and without more variables, we should refrain from concluding a May launched campaign with a goal below $5,000 or between $35,000 and $44,999 would be more succesful.

It would also be easier to contrast the results of "Fever" if we could compare it's data with the rest of the data-set.

## Results

**1. What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**
   * May and June have the most projects launched and the highest succes rates.
   * October and December have the highest failure ratio, despite a lower number of projects being launched.

**2. What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**
   * Projects below $5,000 and those between $35,000 to $44,999 were particularly succesful in reaching their goals.
   * Projects between $25,000 to $34,999 and those over $45,000 had the highest ratio of failed outcomes.

**3. What are some limitations of this dataset?**
   * This dataset gives us a good idea of "WHAT" happenned, but we lack variables to explain "WHY".

**4. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**
   * We could also analyze by country, to have even more specific learnings.
   * We could also contrast our outcomes for the "Theater" category against other categories, to see if these patterns are unique.
